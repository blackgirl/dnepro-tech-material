				<p>Lecithin is widely used in the food industry as a food additive (E-322). Lecithin is a surface active agent – it works well at the phase boundary of different substances. At presence of two immiscible liquid phases, lecithin lowers the surface tension and acts as an emulsifier. When interaction between the solid and liquid phase is necessary, lecithin acts as a wetting and dispersing agent. When using between the solid phases, the substance acts as a lubricating agent. Lecithin is also gave a good account of itself as an agent helping to release products from forms (reduced adhesion to forms).</p>
				<p>While the production of bakery products the use of lecithin leads to better dough processibility, better volume, and increasing keeping time.</p>
				<p>Lecithin stops moisturizing and minimizing wafers crumbling giving them a pleasant color texture and natural crunch.</p>
				<p>At producing crackers, cookies, muffins and pies lecithin application improves the shortening properties and acts as an agent to release products from the mold. Lecithin may also be used in the food industry as an antioxidant (a substance that prevents oxidation).</p>
				<p>The use of lecithin makes it possible to obtain a homogeneous finely-porous crumb compact structure with a flat frame. Sunflower lecithin is an emulsifier which allows you to adjust the acidity and strengthen the gluten frame.</p>
				<p>Lecithin is highly soluble in the dough and allows you to adjust its consistency. Emulsifying properties of the powder simplify the dough machine processing by giving it the necessary dryness. The result of the lecithin usage is a significant decrease in the percentage of defective products.</p>
				<p>In addition, lecithin can replace eggs, if their use is provided for preparing by the recipe. Lecithin will not only become a full-fledged alternative to eggs, but also improve the performance of the dough such as layering and structure.</p>
				<p>The use of lecithin in confectionery provides the dough with strength, its color with uniformity, texture and structure with smoothness. Another lecithin property is to give the finished product a uniform color and reduce the risk of cracking.</p>
				<p>At production biscuits, thanks to lecithin, elastic dough is easily formed. Cookies, prepared with the help of lecithin, become pleasantly crispy, so there is an opportunity to reduce the fat content. Sunflower lecithin reduces the need in fat by 20 – 25% in cookies or any other products. Moreover, lecithin slows fat oxidation, whereby cookies remain fresh longer.</p>
				<p>Sunflower lecithin also helps to form a thin layer around the yeast particles in frozen pizza, thereby protecting the product from shock freezing and damage.</p>
				<p>Suggested dosages of lecithin: from 0.5% to 2% from flour mass.</p>

			      	<p>Modern trends of food assortment improvement may be successfully solved by increasing the volume of biologically active supplements or dietary products production, which occupy the border area between traditional foodstuff and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>One of the most perspective natural biologically active supplements are phospholipids, the source of which is phospholipids concentrate, obtained as a relative “waste” under the hydration of vegetable oil in the process of cleaning. The most biologically active components include L-α-lecithin, which is a constituent of fatless phospholipids concentrate. L-α-lecithin is used for medical purposes at a number of diseases, such as nervous disorder, asthenic syndrome, anemia, hypotension and fatigue.</p>
<p>Essential phospholipids, nowadays it is one of the most valuable biologically active additives. It is not accidentally. Phospholipids are an important element of cellular membranes structure – a surface where the most complicated processes of vital activity not only cells but also the entire human body take place. The content of phospholipids in the liver tissue is 50 %, in human brain is 30%, in nervous system – is 17 %.</p>
<p>One of the main functions of phospholipids is to ensure and maintain normal metabolism in the human body. Today, the number of diseases associated with lipid exchange disorder (atherosclerosis, cholelithiasis, fatty degeneration of liver, etc.) is steadily increasing. The reason for this trend is irrational nutrition and worsening of environmental situation. In addition, due to age-related changes energy reserves of the organism decreases, and cells cannot synthesize phospholipids in the required amounts, which, in its turn, leads to increased fatigability, irritability and defective memory.</p>
<p>Thus, in the basis of all our diseases is the pathology of cellular structures, so their normalization is the prevention and treatment of etiology of illnesses.</p>
<p>Long since scientists have established that having phospholipids with food, we supply building material to affected cells. At the same time the recovery of the organism is significantly faster at any disease. Lecithin is found in quantity in egg yolk, liver, caviar, fatty herring, and unrefined vegetable.</p>
<p>However, to satisfy lecithin need of the organism, which is 5-7 gram per day, from the one hand we need to change the diet completely, which is quite problematic, and from the other hand we need to minimize the consumption of cholesterol and increase the consumption of lecithin.</p>
<p>Dry sunflower lecithin is the most affordable and rational mean in compensation lecithin to the human body.<br>
This ecologically clean product is required by our body every day to maintain health and prevent a number of illnesses.</p>
<p>Whether you consume lecithin powder or lecithin granules, always consume them according to directions. While taking 10 to 30 grams of lecithin per day should not trigger side effects, higher doses may cause such health problems as diarrhea, skin rash, nausea and vomiting, weight gain, dizziness and an abnormal body odor.</p>

				<li>The use of sunflower lecithin in livestock as feed for cattle, poultry, pigs and fish.&nbsp;<a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample3" btn btn-primary>Read more&nbsp;<span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span></a>

			      	<ul>Livestock. The use of sunflower lecithin in feed for cattle, poultry, pigs and fish contributes to:
				<li>Intense weight gain;</li>
				<li>Providing the efficiency of metabolism;</li>
				<li>Stimulyator transport fats;</li>
				<li>Strengthening the immune system;</li>
				<li>More intensive growth;</li>
				<li>For predostvrascheniya liver disease;</li>
				<li>Increase the regeneration of fish diseases after.</li></ul><p>Lecithin carries out an important protective and regulatory function at fats metabolism, therefore it is an irreplaceable additive to a food allowance of livestock, birds and their young growth.</p>
				<p>Lecithin application at feeding has a threefold effect:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Physiological action (control and metabolism activation):
				<ul>
				<li>provides metabolism with efficiency;</li>
				<li>stimulates fats transfer;</li>
				<li>keeps cell walls elastic;</li>
				<li>increases viability and fertility;</li>
				<li>strengthens immunity considerably.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Biological action:
				<ul>
				<li>improves forage digestibility;</li>
				<li>increases assimilability of nutrients and absorbability of vitamins considerably;</li>
				<li>supports animals and birds natural level of energy.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Technical advantages at forages production:
				<ul>
				<li>intensifies homogenization;</li>
				<li>acts as a natural antioxidant.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Lecithin testing which have been carried out at УААН Institute of forages, at number of Ukrainian and Russian farms, and also world experience of using dry phospholipids testify about indisputable positive effect of their use at animals nourishment.</p>
				<p>As tests results show, lecithin steadily stimulates the growth of the majority of animals’ body mass, it makes from 8 to 10% a month (they all were kept and fed under equal conditions). After 30 days of feeding, according to the research results of biochemistry of pigs’ blood serum, the inclusion lecithin in a diet has had the normalizing impact on a metabolism and liver state.</p>
				<p>Lecithin possesses hepatoprotective effect, improves a functional state of liver and promotes decrease in toxic loading on hepatocytes.</p>
				<p><b>Calves</b>.</p>
				<p>Discoveries concerning the improvement of fat absorption when using lecithin are a basis for an assessment of economic advantages of lecithin usage in young calves breeding and fattening. Thus, serious pathologies and a growth inhibition were defined in several cases when feeding calves with synthetic food – casein, lactose, minerals and vitamins. Lecithin using in combination with fats solves these problems. During 56-day experiment the calves having the main diet and hardened soyabean oil with lecithin, gained 13.8 kg of weight in comparison with an gain in weight in 4.9 kg at the animals receiving only low-calorie main forage without fat-plus-lecithin.</p>
				<p>Chickens and birds</p>
				<p>When receiving lecithin together with food chickens showed the best growth and the increased concentration of vitamin A in the liver; besides, a favorable impact of lecithin on bone formation has been observed. Lecithin using is not only accelerates the growth of birds, but also prevents the emergence of perosis. The slowed-down development of chickens, because of the vitamin E deficiency is possible to avoid only when feeding them with lecithin together with alphatocopherol. As soon as lecithin is excluded, effect of tocopherol stops, accurately showing synergistic action of lecithin.</p>
				<p>Lecithin has a huge value at laying hens breeding for protection them from “a syndrome of liver obesity”. The reduced period of egg-laying and increased mortality as a result of this illness which is often arising in commercial poultry yards, lead to considerable financial losses. Researches in this area have not established the reason of this illness emergence. However, it is obvious that pathological liver lipopexia and inability of an organism to bring out this fat significantly depends on feeding.</p>
				<p>As lecithin is an important source of choline and inositol, adding it in a forage of laying hens brings huge benefit.</p>
				<p><b>Fish</b></p>
				<p>Lecithin makes favorable impact on health, growth and food utilization of salmon and trout, especially in cases of adding some fat in their forage. Adding lecithin helps to prevent metabolic processes violation in a liver. Fish suffering from liver obesity, recover more quickly.</p>
